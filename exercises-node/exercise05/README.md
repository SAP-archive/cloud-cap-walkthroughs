# Exercise 5: Create an S/4 Extension with SAP Cloud Application Programming Model and SAP Cloud SDK [optional]

## Estimated time

100 minutes

## Objective

This exercise will take you to the SAP TechEd 2019 App Space mission *S/4HANA Extension with Cloud Application Programming Model*, which will show you how the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model can be used with the SAP Cloud SDK to consume a service from an SAP S/4HANA system in the context of extending core functionality with a new app and service.

Instead of consuming a service from a real SAP S/4HANA system, you’ll create and use a mock service, which mimics the equivalent service in a real SAP S/4HANA system.
